Developed based on our award-winning ERC-7672 protocol, ZeroX Network is introducing a novel concept, the Derivable Asset Utilities (DAUs), that facilitates a Utility Layer on top of the current blockchain assets infrastructure to bridge the considerable gap between the assets and traditional applications like games and beyond. Each application in the Utility Layer will empower an independent and tradable Utility towards any supported assets, facilitating versatility and interoperability of traditional blockchain assets. Trading of DAUs distributes Utility Royalties to the underlying blockchain assets, effectively turning the assets into 'golden shovels/geese' for continuous passive income."
